PROGRESS SO FAR (DAY 1)

1. Image processing:
• Procured 4 band satellite image of AoI (Gularia) from Google Earth and USGS Earth Explorer.
• Obtained the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetative Index) of given AoI.
• Colour coded the NDVI image to better visualize areas of thick vegetation, crops and water bodies broadly (1st filtering process).

2. ML Model:
• Developed an ML model to predict the right fertilizers to be used given weather data and farmer inputs.

3. Website:
• Created the basic framework of the website with most of the relevant information farmers could have use of.

FOR DAY2-PLAN OF ACTION
Second filtration in image processing along with futher refinement of ML model and linking of database (with farmer inputs via website) with the analysis portion for seamless integration of processes to be done.
